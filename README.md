# Fame (Snaphame)

Use the power of community to get seen and help your career. A Snapchat auto-adder. Data comes from https://snaphame.herokuapp.com/ (fill that out before using for sustainability reasons)

## Install Requirements

Make sure to have Python/pip installed as well as Teamviewer, this will allow you to run the mouse moving and data-enabling script over the top of your Teamviewer phone, which is connected to your Snapchat-installed phone. 

## Behind the reason this is so elaborate

This means Snapchat cannot ban you, because you are NOT using a 3rd party API (strictly against ToS). Instead, you are **simply using a disability-enabled service to assist in the adding of your friends**. Snapchat has no ToS violations against adding people you may not know, so this is a completely safe alternative to auto-adding friends.
