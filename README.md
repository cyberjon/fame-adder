## This Python-based keyboard and mouse controller runs the motions of automatically adding people through a Teamviewer connection to a phone with Snapchat installed. It pulls from the Snaphame API to gather names that wish to be added.

# Fame (Snaphame)

Use the power of community to get seen and help your career. A Snapchat auto-adder. Data comes from https://snaphame.herokuapp.com/ (fill that out before using the application so that as many names can be instilled into the root of the app).

## Pre-requirements

- A windows computer (raw Python works on Mac/Linux)
- A phone which can simulate presses from Teamviewer QuickConnect (Android-tested)
-

## Quick install

1. Get Teamviewer QuickConnect on your phone with Snapchat installed
2. Download Teamviewer on your computer that you wish to operate the code on
3. (With Python): Download and run AutoAdder.py (`python AutoAdder.py`)
4. (Without Python): Download and run AutoAdder.exe (Windows only)

Now that you have everything installed, you should see **Waiting for you to press 'enter' (for fame!)**



## Behind the reason this is so elaborate

This means Snapchat cannot ban you, because you are NOT using a 3rd party API (strictly against ToS). Instead, you are **simply using a disability-enabled service to assist in the adding of your friends**. Snapchat has no ToS violations against adding people you may not know, so this is a completely safe alternative to auto-adding friends.
